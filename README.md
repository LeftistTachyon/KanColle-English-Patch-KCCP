Translated textures to be used by the assets modifier of [KCCacheProxy](https://github.com/Tibowl/KCCacheProxy/wiki/Installation-and-setup).\
Now also supports raw text patching, such as ship names etc.\
It's enabled by default. To disable raw text patching, follow the instructions below.

Use at your own risk, make sure to clear your cache when installing/updating.\
Unlike the POI method, the assets don't break when updates happen in the game.\
No ban risk as the API is never touched.

## Instructions
Download the master and extract it anywhere, then use KCCP (right click in the tray)\
to add the mod by checking "Enable assets modifier", saving, then clicking on "Add a patcher".\
From there, select the "EN-patch.mod.json" file inside of the master folder.

Don't forget to close KanColle and clear your browser cache! If some assets still\
aren't patched, repeat the process until satisfaction.\
(be aware some minor stuff still isn't translated)

To disable raw text patching (ship names etc.), open the "EN-patch.mod.json"\
file and replace `"requireScripts": true,` with `"requireScripts": false,`.\
Don't forget to "Reload mod data"!
